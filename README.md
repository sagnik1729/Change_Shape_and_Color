# Change Shape and Color

## Intro
The **Change Shape and Color** project allows users to interact with a simple web interface, changing the color and shape of an object on the page by clicking on two buttons. The "Change Color" button randomly selects a color from a palette, and the "Change Shape" button randomly selects a shape to display.

## Key Features
- Random color and shape generation.
- User-friendly and visually coherent interface.
- Creative design elements and animations.
- Dynamic interaction through JavaScript functions.

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to create a basic interactive web page where users can click on buttons to change the appearance of an object. The buttons trigger JavaScript functions to generate random colors and shapes, making the page interactive and fun to use. The design is simple, with clear labels and buttons for a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Consistent User Interface**: Buttons, labels, and elements are aligned and visually coherent.
- **Visual Variety**: A color palette with at least 10 distinct colors and 5 shapes (triangle, square, circle, rectangle, diamond).
- **Random Color Generation**: Clicking the "Change Color" button generates a random color from the palette.
- **Random Shape Generation**: Clicking the "Change Shape" button randomly selects a shape.
- **Creativity**: Animations and creative design elements enhance the overall project.
